### Requirements
ðŸ˜„ To install requirements:
```
torch
einops
```
### Usage
1. First step
```
$git clone https://github.com/wangleiofficial/FAPEloss.git
```

2. Testing FAPE Loss
```
from fape import FAPEloss
import torch

# define the transformation
predict_T = (torch.randn((1, 1, 3, 3)), torch.randn((1, 1, 3)))
transformation = (torch.randn((1, 1, 3, 3)), torch.randn((1, 1, 3)))

# define loss
fape = FAPEloss()
loss = fape(predict_T, transformation)
```
